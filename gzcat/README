This is a very simple gzcat implementation, based on puff.c from zlib contrib directory.
Only works with gzip files created with 'gzip -n' so far.
All changes are released under the zlib license like the original puff.c.
It compiles to about 4.2kb size on Linux/x86 with the dietlibc library.

TODO:
-add support for the default archives GNU gzip creates
-add minimal error messages
